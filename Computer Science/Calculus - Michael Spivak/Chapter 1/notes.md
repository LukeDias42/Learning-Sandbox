# Basic Properties of Numbers
## Properties
#### P1 - Associative Law for Addition
$$
\text{If a, b, and c are any numbers, then}\\
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c.
$$

#### P2 - Existence of an Additive Identity
$$
\text{If a is any number, then}\\
a + 0 = 0 + a = 0.
$$

#### P3 - Existence of Additive Inverses
$$
\text{ For every number a, there is a number -a such that}\\
a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0.
$$

#### P4 - Commutative Law for Addition
$$
\text{If a and b are any numbers, then}\\
a + b = b + a.
$$

#### P5 - Associative Law for Multiplication
$$
\text{If a, b and c are any numbers, then}\\
a\times(b\times c) = (a\times b)\times c.
$$

#### P6 - Existence of a Multiplicative Identity
$$
\text{If a is any numbers, then}\\
a\times1 = 1\times a = a.\\
\text{Moreover, $1 \neq 0$}
$$

#### P7 - Existence of Multiplicative Inverses
$$
\text{For every number $ a \neq 0$, there is a number $a^{-1}$ such that}\\
a\times a^{-1} = a^{-1}\times a = 1.
$$

#### P8 - Commutative Law for Multiplication
$$
\text{If a and b are any numbers, then}\\
a\times b = b\times a.
$$

#### P9 - Distributive Law
$$
\text{If a, b and c are any numbers, then}\\
a\times (b+c) = a\times b + a\times c.
$$

> P is the collection of all positive numbers.

#### P10 - Trichotomy Law
$$
\text{For every number a, one and only one of the following holds}\\
\text{(i) $a=0$,}\\
\text{(ii) a is in collection P,}\\
\text{(iii) -a is in the collection P.}\\
$$

#### P11 - Closure under addition
$$
\text{If a and b are in P, then $ a + b $ is in P.}\\
$$

#### P12 - Closure under Multiplication
$$
\text{If a and b are in P, then $ a \times b $ is in P.}\\
$$

## Proofs
### Proving $a + x = a$ then $x = 0$
From these we can can prove that, if a number satisfies
$$ a + x = a $$
for any one number a, then x = 0.

To prove this, we need to use all three properties P1-P3:
|       |                             |
|-------|:---------------------------:|
| If    |          $a+x = a$          |
| Then  | $(-a)+(a+x) = a + (-a) = 0$ |
| Hence |      $((-a) + a)+x = 0      |
| Hence |           $0+x=0$           |
| Hence |            $x=0$            |
