### Question:
Find a simple formula for:
$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} (2k -1)$$

### Answer:
By the linearity property we can split the formula:
$$2\sum_{k=0}^{n} k - \sum_{k=0}^{n} 1$$

The first summation is a arithmetic series equation:
$$2\sum_{k=0}^{n} k = 2\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2} = n(n+1)$$

The second summation is just 1+1+...+1 n times, therefore the simplified formula is:
$$n(n+1) - n = n[(n+1) - 1] = nÂ²$$
