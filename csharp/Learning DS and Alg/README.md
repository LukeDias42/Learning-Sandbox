## About this Project

This is a simple project to study Data Structures and Algorithms. I am going to program some Data Structures in C# to practice and expand my knowledge. This is ust for studying purposes, not a very useful project otherwise, since C# already has the implementation of most of the Data Structures, but I hope it will help me learn and get a lot of practices.
I might also add Coding Challanges I've found and some random algorithms, the more the merrier.

### Built With
* C# 8
